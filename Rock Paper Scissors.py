# Rock, Paper, Scissors
# Create a python code to write interactive programs of game Rock, Paper, Scissors. You(or player) and computer(or bot
# whatever you say) will play this game against each other.
# The player enters one of the words, and the computer randomly
# selects one and compares it with the player to see who wins.
# If the vocabulary entered by the player is incorrect, printï¼š "That's not a valid play. Check your spelling!"
# If it's a draw, print: "Tie!"
# If the player lost, print: "You lose!, Paper (computer), covers, Rock (player)"
# If the player wins, print:  "You win!, Paper (player), covers, Rock (computer)"
# The "covers" can be replaced as "smashes" or "cuts" depends on the situation.
